Enter a query: How to build strong habits
 Building strong habits requires a combination of strategies that work together. Here are some tips for building good habits:
1. Set clear intentions - Make sure your goal is specific enough so it's easy to remember what you're working towards. 
2. Break down the habit into smaller steps - This will make breaking bad habits easier and more manageable. For example, if you want to 
quit smoking, break up a cigarette by taking small puffs instead of one big puff. 
3. Use positive reinforcement - Reward yourself for making progress in your goal or reaching milestones along the way. It's important not to overdo it with rewards as they can become counterproductive and lead to bad habits being formed again later on.

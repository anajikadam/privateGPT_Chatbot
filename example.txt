Benefits of using Python:
Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-
learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of
program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is
completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging
modularity and code reuse.
Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic

Enter a query: What is PEP 8 and why is it important
 PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, which are official design documents that provide information to the Python community or describe new features for Python or its processes. The eighth proposal in this series (PEPS) was released on January 1st, 2021 by Guido van Rossum and is titled "Python 3 Compatibility Improvements". This document outlines changes made to Python's syntax between versions 2.7 and 3.0 that aim to make it easier to write code compatible with both older and newer versions of the language. The importance of this 
proposal lies in its potential impact on maintaining compatibility across different platforms, as well as ensuring a consistent coding style for developers working within the Python community.

3.   What is an Interpreted language?
An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as
Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages.
Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with
no intermediary compilation step.
